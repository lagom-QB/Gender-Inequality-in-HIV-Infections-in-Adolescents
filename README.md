### Table Columns :

> - Estimated incidence rate of new HIV infection per 1 000 uninfected population 
> - Estimated number of annual AIDS related deaths
> - Estimated number of annual new HIV infections
> - Estimated number of people living with HIV
> - Estimated rate of annual AIDS related deaths  per 100 000 population

# Question
> -  What is the trend of the spread of the disease as the years go by? 

# 📝 
- The **Age** Column is useless because the whole study focuses on adolescents aged 10-19
- I didn't find the **UNICEF Region** column necessary unless i planned to use a map which i didn't think it would be interesting to use.
- I was not interested in the deaths related to HIV so i didn't use the **Estimated rate of annual AIDS related deaths  per 100 000 population** and **Estimated number of annual AIDS related deaths** columns.
